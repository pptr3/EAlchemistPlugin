 * Declaration of the filter mappings in this web application. The container uses the filter-mapping declarations to decide which filters to apply to a request, and in what order. The container matches the request URI to a Servlet in the normal way. To determine which filters to apply it matches filter-mapping declarations either on servlet-name, or on url-pattern for each filter-mapping element, depending on which style is used. The order in which filters are invoked is the order in which filter-mapping declarations that match a request URI for a servlet appear in the list of filter-mapping elements.The filter-name value must be the value of the <filtername> sub-elements of one of the <filter> declarations in the deployment descriptor.
 * 
 * @invariant The filter-name value must be the value of the Filter::name of one of the Filter declarations in the deployment descriptor.
