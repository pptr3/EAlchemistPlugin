/**
 * Used as an optimization for reading jars within jars. Reading from a ZipFile is much faster than
 * from a ZipInputStream, therefore, when possible, it makes sense to copy the nested jar to a temp
 * file. It is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the temp file gets deleted on normal
 * system exit, using the helper method on java.io.File. This adapter will also delete the file
 * when closed or finalized.
