Bundle-Name.0 = JEM Beaninfo VM Jar
Bundle-Vendor.0 = Eclipse Web Tools Platform
Bundle-Description.0 = This bundle is used only as a jar by the org.eclipse.jem.beaninfo bundle, so it should never be "pre-req'd" by others, only by o.e.jem.beaninfo. Extenders would use only that o.e.jem.beaninfo bundle.
